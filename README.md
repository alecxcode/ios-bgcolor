### App idea: a Decision Maker App

The idea is to create an app that can help people make decisions (a Decision Maker App). There are many ways for people to evaluate the pros and cons of certain choices. Sometimes, this requires knowledge of probability, which may be counterintuitive for some. The situation becomes particularly challenging when a person is faced with multiple choices, all of which seem to have drawbacks. The app can utilize advanced mathematics, such as probability theory, as well as findings from psychological research, to offer optimal solutions based on user input.

## Notes

The following challenges existed during development. The app crashed several times while it was in the process of development. 
Changing UI components and rewriting portions of code fixed the issue completely
